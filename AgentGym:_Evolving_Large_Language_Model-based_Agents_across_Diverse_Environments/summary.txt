The document titled "AGENT GYM: Evolving Large Language Model-based Agents across Diverse Environments" introduces a framework aimed at developing versatile agents capable of adapting to various tasks and environments without human intervention. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to equip agents with generalized capabilities. The framework consists of three key components: diverse environments for agent exploration, a trajectory set for basic skills and knowledge, and an efficient evolution method. By providing a range of environments and tasks for agent exploration, AGENT GYM enables real-time, concurrent learning. Additionally, it includes a comprehensive database, benchmark suite, and high-quality trajectories to facilitate agent development. The document also presents AGENT EVOL, a novel method for agent self-evolution across tasks and environments, showcasing that evolved agents can achieve state-of-the-art results. The AGENT GYM suite, comprising the platform, dataset, benchmarks, checkpoints, and algorithm implementations, is made available to the research community. This work represents a significant step towards creating generally-capable LLM-based agents with self-evolution capabilities, contributing to the advancement of AI research and development.
